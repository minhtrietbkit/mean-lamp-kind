## Deploy MEAN / LAMP Stack on KIND Cluster

### Deploy MEAN Stack app on KIND Cluster

_Note_: The MEAN app's source is [here](https://github.com/SinghDigamber/mean-stack-angular-7-crud-app-example). I simply changed it a bit to suit the purpose of this demo.

Start cluster and app

```Bash
bash start-app.sh mean
```
